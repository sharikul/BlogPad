# Editing Posts
It's very simple to edit posts in BlogPad. Simply click the 'View Posts' tab and then click on the title of the post that you want to edit. 

For this example, we'll edit the demo post "I wrote this post in Internet Explorer".

In this screen, you also have the ability to delete a post.

Since the demo post is a dynamic one, we have the ability to convert it to a static post. As of now, there's no functionality to convert a static post to a dynamic post. 

During conversion, the post will be removed from the database, and its contents will form a new static post.
