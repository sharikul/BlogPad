# Adding Posts
It's very simple to create a post. A title, a body, categories, a slug and a description is all that's needed to create a post. The web editor also provides you with the ability to **live preview** your blog post as it would look like if you were to be viewing your post on its own.

When entering a title for your post, the web editor will automatically sanitize it and "slug" it.

## Example post

Categories to attach to a post should be defined in _settings.php_ (and is explained in `getting-started/getting_started.md`).

### Previewing the post
As aforementioned, the web editor provides you with the option of live-previewing a post before publishing. Simply click "Preview Post" and a modal will appear. This is what the example post will look like when previewed (_the theme at the point of writing was not fully developed_):
