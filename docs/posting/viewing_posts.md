# Viewing Posts
If you're logged in, you can click on the 'View Posts' tab of the admin dashboard which will take you to a screen that displays your blog posts. 

This is what it looks like if your blog contains posts:

And this is what it looks like if your blog does not contain posts:
![No Posts](http://i.imgur.com/bavTnGn.png)

You'll also be able to see which posts are static and dynamic, as well as have the ability to edit them (_by clicking on the title_).
