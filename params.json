So you'll need to delegate routing to BlogPad through a .htaccess file.\r\n\r\n`RewriteEngine On\r\nRewriteBase /blog/\r\n\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f\r\nRewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d\r\nRewriteRule . /blog/index.php [L]\r\n`\r\n\r\n**`blog` denotes that BlogPad's files are stored within a directory called `/blog/`. If it's stored in a different directory, `blog` will be replaced with the name of the directory on your computer/server. If it's not in a directory (i.e. root), RewriteBase will be `RewriteBase /` and RewriteRule will be `RewriteRule ./index.php [L]`**.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
